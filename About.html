			<h2 style="color: #000080 ">Parish history</h2>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">St. Luke Orthodox Church, Kabonge, dates as far back as mid 1920’s, started by our ancestors in faith, Bsp. Spartas and Archm.Obadia, the historical pioneers of the Orthodox Church in Uganda. These two, we are told, got the impetus when the late Dawudi Mutamanyangamba, who also served this initial community as a lay reader, donated 7.1 acres of land for God’s work. Spartas and his colleague wanted to establish their center here, but this place was forested and far from the highway, so they went further to look for a better highway-positioned place to ease their transport routine. This exodus eventually destined them at Degeya, but it somehow affected the growth of this community because it meant that the community’s congregation was not as regular as it should have been. The religious wars and political instability that ensued in the latter years all through the 1970’s almost completely erased this community, in the spiritual sense. The small mud-made school initially set up by our pioneers remained the only symbol of orthodoxy in here for a very long time. It was not until the early 1980’s that the Holy Metropolis under the reign of Bsp. Theodorus, was able to revive the community. He started the construction of a chapel, which God didn’t allow him to complete but blessed his throne successor, Bsp. Jonah to accomplish and officially dedicate it to St. Luke the Apostle and Evangelist in 2009.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">It should be noted that for a very long time, the community never had a regular priest, which greatly affected and stagnated her Mystical life. Priests like Fr. Emmanuel Mulunga, Fr. Patrick, Fr. Erias Buzinde, Fr. Emmanuel Sekyewa, Fr. Makarios Kizza, Fr. Costantinos Semakula, and Fr. John Kibuka Bossa, all served this parish on part-time basis. They could visit the parish once in a while, due to a lot of commitment, with very few priests around. Fr. John Kibuka improved the community’s congregation frequency in 2003 by dedicating a Lay-Reader (James Sessaazi) and, increasing the frequency of his visits here. And, thanks to God, some two families patiently held on until clerical servants were eventually commissioned here. The first servant to fully be commissioned here was Fr. Josephat Ssemakula in 2007. He did a lot in rekindling the spirit and reshaping the place to be more locatable.Currently, our parish has 18 families with 92 members, majority of whom are underage.</p><div><span style="color: #FF0000 "> <p> Below are some of the priests who have served our parish from the 1980s to date<br>.</p></span>
